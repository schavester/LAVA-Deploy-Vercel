<p><strong>About the tour:</strong> This is the definitive tour of Tom Waits&#8217; formative creative life in Los Angeles, and the people, places and late night pastries that shaped it.Â Calling all rain dogs, gin-soaked boys and Gun Street girls! Climb aboard as your hosts David Smay (author of the 33 1/3 series book on <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0826427820/ref=nosim/bubblegumbook" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swordfishtrombones</a></em>) and Esotouric&#8217;s Kim Cooper (a Zoetrope Studios intern who&#8217;ll tell how she used teenage subterfuge to arrange a private concert by Tom) lead you on a scrupulously researched ride through Tom&#8217;s epic misdeeds and shenanigans, from the Trashing of the Troubadour to epic nights at the Tropicana.</p>
<p>And oh, there are such tales to tell, from food fights with L.A. Punks and smackdowns with L.A. Police. We&#8217;ll crawl through the Sewers of Paris, tattle on the Ivar Theater, and get the lowdown on Tom&#8217;s legendary performances at the Wiltern and elsewhere. Before departing for points rural, Tom left his mark all over L.A., from Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s Zoetrope Studios to Sunset Sound to Skid Row. We&#8217;ll show you where Tom found his true love and collaborator, Kathleen Brennan, and how all the pieces came together to transform a drunken, desperate singer into the multi-faceted, multi-media artist he&#8217;d become.</p>
<p>Raised near San Diego, Tom Waits launched his musical career in L.A., signing with David Geffen&#8217;s Asylum Records in 1972, living at the raunchy Tropicana Hotel (where he sawed off the kitchen drain board so his piano would fit), and building a reputation as a songwriter willing to risk his own health and sanity to get inside the sad sack characters that peopled songs like &#8220;The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me),&#8221; &#8220;On The Nickel&#8221; and &#8220;Pasties And A G-string (At The Two O&#8217;clock Club).&#8221;</p>
<p>By 1980, Tom was 31 and starting to feel the effects of his hard living. While scoring the music to Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s &#8220;One From The Heart,&#8221; he met Kathleen Brennan, whose influence would completely transform his life and his art. After a whirlwind courtship the pair married and began a 28-year creative and personal partnership, beginning with the revolutionary album <em>Swordfishtrombones</em>, the subject of tour host David Smay&#8217;s book.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crawling Down Cahuenga&#8221; spans Tom&#8217;s personal city, from The Nickel (aka Skid Row) to once-ratty West Hollywood, favorite strip clubs and midnight diners, recording studios, night clubs, record labels and film studios, before rolling back downtown via the filming location of Waits&#8217; &#8220;In The Neighborhood&#8221; video.</p>

<p><strong>About the tour:</strong> This is the definitive tour of Tom Waits&#8217; formative creative life in Los Angeles, and the people, places and late night pastries that shaped it.Â Calling all rain dogs, gin-soaked boys and Gun Street girls! Climb aboard as your hosts David Smay (author of the 33 1/3 series book on <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0826427820/ref=nosim/bubblegumbook" target="_blank">Swordfishtrombones</a></em>) and Esotouric&#8217;s Kim Cooper (a Zoetrope Studios intern who&#8217;ll tell how she used teenage subterfuge to arrange a private concert by Tom) lead you on a scrupulously researched ride through Tom&#8217;s epic misdeeds and shenanigans, from the Trashing of the Troubadour to epic nights at the Tropicana.</p>
<p>And oh, there are such tales to tell, from food fights with L.A. Punks and smackdowns with L.A. Police. We&#8217;ll crawl through the Sewers of Paris, tattle on the Ivar Theater, and get the lowdown on Tom&#8217;s legendary performances at the Wiltern and elsewhere. Before departing for points rural, Tom left his mark all over L.A., from Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s Zoetrope Studios to Sunset Sound to Skid Row. We&#8217;ll show you where Tom found his true love and collaborator, Kathleen Brennan, and how all the pieces came together to transform a drunken, desperate singer into the multi-faceted, multi-media artist he&#8217;d become.</p>
<p>Raised near San Diego, Tom Waits launched his musical career in L.A., signing with David Geffen&#8217;s Asylum Records in 1972, living at the raunchy Tropicana Hotel (where he sawed off the kitchen drain board so his piano would fit), and building a reputation as a songwriter willing to risk his own health and sanity to get inside the sad sack characters that peopled songs like &#8220;The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me),&#8221; &#8220;On The Nickel&#8221; and &#8220;Pasties And A G-string (At The Two O&#8217;clock Club).&#8221;</p>
<p>By 1980, Tom was 31 and starting to feel the effects of his hard living. While scoring the music to Francis Ford Coppola&#8217;s &#8220;One From The Heart,&#8221; he met Kathleen Brennan, whose influence would completely transform his life and his art. After a whirlwind courtship the pair married and began a 28-year creative and personal partnership, beginning with the revolutionary album <em>Swordfishtrombones</em>, the subject of tour host David Smay&#8217;s book.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crawling Down Cahuenga&#8221; spans Tom&#8217;s personal city, from The Nickel (aka Skid Row) to once-ratty West Hollywood, favorite strip clubs and midnight diners, recording studios, night clubs, record labels and film studios, before rolling back downtown via the filming location of Waits&#8217; &#8220;In The Neighborhood&#8221; video.</p>
